## üéØ Vision
ai agents are clearly the future and the entire workforce will be replaced or atleast using ai agents. while i am a quant and building agents for algo trading i will be contributing to all different types of ai agent flows and placing all of the agents here for free, 100% open sourced because i beleive code is the great equalizer and we have never seen a regime shift like this so i need to get this code to the people

feel free to join [our discord](https://discord.gg/8UPuVZ53bh) if you beleive ai agents will be integrated into the workforce

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide - RBI Backtesting Agent

**Why Start with Backtesting?**

Before running ANY trading algorithm or AI agent with real money, you MUST backtest your strategies. Backtesting shows you how a strategy would have performed on historical data. The RBI (Research-Based Inference) Agent automates this entire process for you.

**What is the RBI Agent?**

The RBI Agent takes your trading ideas (from YouTube videos, PDFs, or plain text) and:
1. üß† Uses AI to understand the trading strategy
2. üíª Codes a complete backtest using the `backtesting.py` library
3. üìä Tests across 20+ different market data sources
4. ‚úÖ Only saves strategies that pass a 1% return threshold
5. üéØ Tries to optimize strategies to hit a 50% target return

**Python Version:** 3.10.9 was used during development

### Step 1: ‚≠ê Star & Fork the Repo
- Click the star button to save it to your GitHub favorites
- Fork to your GitHub account to get your own copy
- This lets you make changes and track updates

### Step 2: üíª Clone to Your Machine
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/moon-dev-ai-agents-for-trading.git
cd moon-dev-ai-agents-for-trading
```

**Recommended IDEs:**
- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) - AI-enabled coding
- [Windsurfer](https://codeium.com/) - AI-enabled coding

### Step 3: üîë Set Up Environment Variables

The RBI Agent needs API keys to function. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env
```

**Required API Keys for RBI Agent:**

```bash
# AI Model APIs (you need at least ONE of these)
ANTHROPIC_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here          # Claude models (recommended)
OPENAI_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here                # GPT models
DEEPSEEK_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here            # DeepSeek models (cheap!)
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here                # Groq (fast inference)
GEMINI_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here                # Google Gemini
XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here                  # Grok models

# Market Data APIs (for downloading price data)
BIRDEYE_API_KEY=your_birdeye_api_key_here          # Solana token data
COINGECKO_API_KEY=your_coingecko_api_key_here      # Crypto market data
```

**Where to Get API Keys:**
- **Anthropic Claude**: https://console.anthropic.com/
- **OpenAI GPT**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **DeepSeek**: https://platform.deepseek.com/ (very cheap, great for backtesting)
- **Groq**: https://console.groq.com/
- **Google Gemini**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
- **xAI Grok**: https://console.x.ai/
- **BirdEye**: https://birdeye.so/ (Solana data)
- **CoinGecko**: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit or share your `.env` file! It's in .gitignore for your safety.**

### Step 4: üì¶ Install Dependencies

Using conda (recommended):
```bash
conda create -n tflow python=3.10.9
conda activate tflow
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using pip directly:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: üß™ Run Your First Backtest

**Option A: Single Strategy Test**

Create a file called `ideas.txt` in `src/data/rbi_pp_multi/`:

```
Buy when RSI < 30 and sell when RSI > 70
```

Then run:
```bash
python src/agents/rbi_agent_pp_multi.py
```

**Option B: Use the Web Dashboard**

Start the dashboard:
```bash
cd src/data/rbi_pp_multi
python app.py
```

Open browser to: `http://localhost:8000`

Click "New Backtests" and enter your strategy ideas!

### Step 6: üìä Understanding Results

The agent will:
- Process your strategy idea
- Generate backtest code
- Test across 20+ market datasets (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- Show results in a table with:
  - Return %
  - Buy & Hold %
  - Max Drawdown
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Sortino Ratio
  - Number of Trades

**Only strategies returning > 1% are saved to the CSV.**

Results are saved to:
- `src/data/rbi_pp_multi/backtest_stats.csv` - All passing backtests
- `src/data/rbi_pp_multi/user_folders/` - Organized by run name

### Step 7: üîç Analyze Backtest Code

Find your strategy files in:
```
src/data/rbi_pp_multi/10_25_2025_09_08/
```

Each successful backtest has:
- **Python file**: The actual backtest code you can review and modify
- **Results**: Performance metrics

**Read the code!** This is how you learn what works and what doesn't.

## üéØ Configuration - RBI Agent

All settings are in `src/agents/rbi_agent_pp_multi.py` (lines 130-132):

```python
# üéØ PROFIT TARGET CONFIGURATION
TARGET_RETURN = 50  # Target return in % (AI tries to optimize to this)
SAVE_IF_OVER_RETURN = 1.0  # Save backtest to CSV if return > this %
```

**How it works:**
- AI tries to optimize strategies to hit **50% return**
- But ANY backtest returning **> 1%** gets saved to CSV
- This way you can review all decent strategies, not just perfect ones

**Other Settings:**
```python
MAX_WORKERS = 18  # Number of parallel threads (adjust based on your CPU)
DEBUG_BACKTEST_ERRORS = True  # Auto-fix coding errors with AI
MAX_DEBUG_ITERATIONS = 10  # How many times to try fixing errors
```

---

## üìö Advanced: Adding Custom Data Sources

Want to test on your own tokens? Edit the data list in `rbi_agent_pp_multi.py` (lines 157-178):

```python
ALL_DATA_CONFIGS = [
    # Crypto data from CoinGecko/BirdEye
    {'symbol': 'BTC-USD', 'timeframe': '15m', 'days_back': 90},
    {'symbol': 'ETH-USD', 'timeframe': '15m', 'days_back': 90},
    {'symbol': 'SOL-USD', 'timeframe': '15m', 'days_back': 90},

    # Add your own token (Solana contract address)
    {'symbol': 'YOUR_TOKEN_ADDRESS', 'timeframe': '1H', 'days_back': 30},
]
```

The agent will automatically download and cache the data.
